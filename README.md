Open the jupter notebook fast-rcBK.ipynb and evaluate the cells.
It will load the already trained random forest model. Then provide a dipole at the initial x=0.01 and compute the predicted dipole at an x of your choice and a scale parameter C^2 of your choice.
An example is given in fast-rcBK.ipynb.
